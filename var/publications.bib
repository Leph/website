        We present a new design of foot pressure sensors in the context of small low-cost robots. 
        We design the robot in the context of RoboCup kid-size humanoid league (i.e. the robot size must be lower than 90 cm). 
        A new challenge is to walk on artificial grass of 3 cm height, which essentially means a soft irregular floor. 
        In this context, one cannot use full 6-axis force sensors for cost and mechanical integration reasons. 
        Classically, FSR sensors are used to handle foot pressure with unclear efficiency. 
        Instead of that, we propose to use low cost strain gauge originally designed for scales. 
        The strain gauge is made of resistors network glued on a aluminium beam. 
        In our design, the aluminium beams are themselves full parts of the mechanical structure of the foot. 
        Therefore, we measure directly the deformation of the foot and thus the force applied on it in a robust way. 
        We use this system in order to measure the position of the centre of pressure under the foot, 
        in order to balance motor primitives of the robot: perturbation rejection, locomotion, shoot. 
        First experiments are promising and we plan to set up a rigorous comparison with the ZMP.

    organization={IEEE},
    abstract={
        Odometry is an important element for the localization of mobile
        robots.
        For humanoid robots, it is very prone to
        integration errors, due to mechanical complexity, uncertainties and foot/ground
        contacts.
        Most of the time, a visual odometry is then used to encompass these
        problems.
        In this work we propose a method to compensate for odometry drifting using machine learning
        on a small size low-cost humanoid without vision.
        This method is tested on different ground conditions and exhibits a
        significant improvement in odometry accuracy.

        This paper introduces an open-source 3D printed low-cost legged
        robot environment designed for educational purposes.  
        The platform, called Metabot, is already operational and is
        currently experienced by teachers and pupils. 
        The robot as a teaching aid, has several advantages: at first, it is
        stimulating for pupils, especially legged robots. Second, robotics
        is multidisciplinary and centralizes a broad spectrum of knowledge
        for the pupils; in particular, it allows to introduce programming in
        a concrete environment, which is now an important need in
        school. Finally, legged robots can illustrate concretely several
        matters of geometry.

        In this paper, we describe an optimization approach to the legged locomotion problem.

        It allows to generate dynamic models and simulate them using a

        In this paper, we present an alternative open-source firmware for the Dynamixel MX-64 servo-motor.
        We discuss software features to fully exploit the hardware capabilities of the device.
        In order to enhance the default controller, a friction model and an electric model of the motor are embedded into the firmware.
        The parameters of the model are found using a black-box optimization algorithm.
        A feed-forward method is proposed to follow position, speed and torque trajectories.
        The approach is tested with a highly dynamic kick movement on our humanoid soccer robot Sigmaban
        whose torque trajectories are computed using a classic rigid body inverse dynamics.
        The comparison between the default control strategy and the proposed one shows significant
        improvements in terms of accuracy, delay and repeatability.

    abstract={
        Optimizing policies for real-time control of humanoid robots is a
        difficult task due to the continuous and stochastic nature of the state and
        action spaces. In this paper, we propose a learning procedure to train a
        predictive motion model and RFPI, a solver for continuous-state and action MDP. 
        We use the predictive model as a transition model to train policies for a robot
        soccer.
        Our method requires no external hardware, a small amount of human
        work and manages to outperform the expert policy used by our team Rhoban winning
        the last 2016 edition of the Robocup in kid-size soccer league.
        Moreover, the proposed method is able to adapt to non-holonomic robots more 
        efficiently than the expert approach. 
        Our results are confirmed by both simulations and real robot experiments.
